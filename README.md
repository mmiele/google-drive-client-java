# google-drive-client-java
This example demonstrates how to build a Google Drive client application in Java.
This is a simple command line client application that eliminates unnecessary clutter and shows the basic logic to interact with Google Drive. Hopefully this will help you to understand the syntax (and semantic) of the API.

The application interacts with the <a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/web/about-sdk" target="_blank">Google Drive</a> via its REST API using the related Google Java client library. For more information, see <a href="https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/" target="_blank">Google API Client Libraries</a>.  See also, The <a href="http://acloudysky.com/?s=conundrum" target="_blank">REST API Conundrum</a>. 

The application uses a custom <a href="http://acloudysky.com/authenticate-google-cloud-service-client-application/" target="_blank">client authentication application</a> to be authorized to use the service.
