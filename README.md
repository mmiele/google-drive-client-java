# google-drive-client-java
This example demonstrates how to build a Google Drive client application in Java.
This is a simple command line client application that eliminates unnecessary clutter and shows the basic logic to interact with Google Drive. Hopefully this will help you to understand the syntax (and semantic) of the API.

The application interacts with the Google Drive via its REST API using the related Google Java client library. For more information, see Google API Client Libraries.  See also, The REST API Conundrum.
